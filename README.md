Project is using nodejs, mongodb, angularjs, and express.

Install the Node modules and web packages with

    npm install

    bower install


then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with

    node server

You might see a message that says,

    Error: Module did not self-register.]
    js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version

Don't worry about this; the code will still work.
