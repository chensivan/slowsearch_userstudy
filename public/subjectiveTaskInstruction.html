  <h1>Part 2 (13 min): </h1>
  <p>There are 7 JavaScript tasks in this part, and we will provide you three answers to each task. These three answers are all correct but in different level of quality (increasing order: recipe level -> pseudocode level -> copy and paste level). You will need to drag each given radio button to tell us how long you are willing to wait for each level of answer. Once you finish your selection, click "Submit" button to continue. (you need to make some changes to the radio button to activate the submit button)</p>
