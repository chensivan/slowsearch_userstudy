  <h1>Part 3 (40 min):</h1>
  <p>You will be given seven (7) JavaScript tasks to complete, and you will be required to write code in the given editor to finish the task. You may check whether you have the right answer at any time by clicking the ‘Run’ button provided below the editor. The system will indicate whether or not your answer is correct. You must answer correctly in order to activate the ‘Next’ button and move on to your next task. For all seven tasks, you are required to produce console log output.</p>
  <p>In this part, you are allowed to use Google to retrieval information, or other resources you have. If you couldn't solve them, you could move on to the next tasks after 10 minutes (each task has 10 min upper limit). The system will prompt you when you can move on to the next task. There is no penalty or salary deduction if you didn't finish them. </p>
